Some of the main features of termux are as follows:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Linux Toolkits</strong>: You can install over 1,000 packages which are compiled for ARM/x86 architectures including <em>compilers</em> (C/C++, Rust, Go), <em>interpreters</em> (Python, Ruby, Node.js), <em>editors</em> (Vim, Emacs), and <em>utilities</em> like Git.</p></li><li><p><strong>No Root Required</strong>: You can use termux without worrying about rooting and other additional setups. It uses isolation via PRoot instead of chroot to maintain security.</p><blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Although no root is required to run termux, some <em>additional packages</em> may require root to run properly.</p></blockquote></li><li><p><strong>Official Add-Ons</strong>: There are several official add-ons such as <strong>Termux:API</strong> (access to Android features via CLI), <strong>Styling</strong> (custom fonts and themes), and other integrations for extended workflows such as \u2014 <strong>Boats</strong>, <strong>Float</strong>, <strong>Widget</strong>, <strong>GUI</strong>, and <strong>Tasker</strong>.</p></li></ul>',7),a=[n];function s(d,l,u,c,h,g){return o(),t("div",null,a)}const f=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{p as __pageData,f as default};
